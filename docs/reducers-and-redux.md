# The Reducers and Redux

In a React application, [reducers](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer) and [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) serve distinct but complementary roles, especially for managing state. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each:

**Reducer in React**

A reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state. It's fundamental to state management patterns like Redux, but you can also use reducers in React with the `useReducer` hook, which is helpful for managing more complex state logic in components that might be cumbersome with `useState`.

```js
const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

**Redux**

Redux is a state management library used primarily for managing application state globally and making it accessible across any component in your app, irrespective of the component hierarchy. It uses a single store, actions to represent changes, and reducers to handle those actions and update the state accordingly.

```js
// Action Types
const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';

// Action Creators
function increment() {
  return { type: INCREMENT };
}

function decrement() {
  return { type: DECREMENT };
}

// Reducer
function counterReducer(state = { count: 0 }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case DECREMENT:
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// Store creation
const store = Redux.createStore(counterReducer);

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()));

// Dispatch actions
store.dispatch(increment());
store.dispatch(decrement());
```

**Choosing Between useReducer and Redux**

-   `Use useReducer` if you need to manage localized state of complex nature in a component or across a small subset of components.
-   `Use Redux` when you need to manage global state that needs to be shared across many parts of your application, or when you need features like middleware support, time-travel debugging, and persistence.

Both tools help manage state transitions predictably and are invaluable in scalable applications. If you're deciding which to use, consider the scale and requirements of your project, including team familiarity and existing infrastructure.
